🟢 Eclip.pro — Master Specification (Platform + Anti-Cheat + Infra)

Purpose of this document:
This is the full product + technical + gameplay spec for Eclip.pro, a competitive CS2 platform with its own progression, economy, servers, and anti-cheat.
It defines what we’re building, how it works, and which services we’re using (all free or credit-based for now).

1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
1.1 What is Eclip.pro?

Eclip.pro is a third-party competitive platform for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), similar in spirit to FACEIT/ESEA, but:

With a modern neon/green design and clean UI.

With transparent progression (XP, levels, ranks, missions).

With a soft currency (coins) that players earn by playing.

With cosmetics (frames, banners, badges, titles) instead of pay-to-win.

With a Windows anti-cheat client + server-side analysis.

With Google Cloud CS2 servers, spun up on demand to save money.

Players:

Log in with email and Steam.

Queue for 5v5 matches on Eclip servers.

Gain XP, ranks, coins, achievements, cosmetics.

Spend coins on cosmetics and possibly Steam gift cards once they reach a threshold.

Admins & moderators:

Manage users, bans, matches, cosmetics, site config.

Monitor anti-cheat events and suspicious players.

Toggle maintenance mode, update logo/banner, manage rewards.

1.2 Target Users

CS2 players who want:

Fair(er) matchmaking.

Clear progression.

Rewards for playtime (coins → cosmetics/gift cards).

Small teams/stacked friends who want to queue together.

Streamers who want an alternative platform to FACEIT/ESEA.

1.3 Key Differentiators

Progression & Cosmetics: Levels, ranks, trophies, inventory, flashy profile.

Soft Currency & Rewards: Coins from playing, daily missions, achievements.

Anti-Cheat Transparency: Admins see AC events per match/player.

Modern UX: Mobile-friendly, responsive, attractive neon/green style.

Cost-Optimized Servers: Servers spin up only when matches exist, using existing Google Cloud credits, Neon free plan, Redis free tier, Vercel free tier, Cloudinary free tier.

2. TECH STACK & INFRASTRUCTURE
2.1 Frontend

Framework: Next.js (React + TypeScript)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animation: Framer Motion

Rendering: SSR + static for landing

UI direction:

Dark theme

Neon green accents

Rounded cards, glassmorphism/blur in some areas

2.2 Backend

You can implement the backend as:

Option 1 (simple): Next.js API routes (Pages router) as the API.

Option 2 (more structured): Separate backend service (Express/Nest) later.

For planning, we assume:

Backend = Node.js + TypeScript

Uses:

PostgreSQL (Neon)

Redis (cloud free tier)

Cloudinary for images

SMTP via one.com for email

Steam OpenID / WebAPI for Steam login & stats

Backend responsibilities:

Auth & sessions

User profiles & progression

Matchmaking & queue

Matches & stats

Coin rewards & transactions

Shop & inventory

Missions & achievements

Anti-cheat event ingestion

Admin/mod tools

Notifications & chat (basic version at first)

2.3 Database

Primary DB: Neon (PostgreSQL)

Everything persists here:

Users, sessions, tokens

Profiles, cosmetics, inventory

Matches, match players, queue tickets

Servers, AC events, bans

Shop items, transactions, leaderboards

Threads, messages, notifications

Admin logs & config

2.4 Cache & Queue

Redis (e.g., Redis Cloud free tier):

Matchmaking queue tickets (light data)

Active players online

Rate limiting data

Possibly ephemeral match states

2.5 Storage

Cloudinary:

User avatars (if not using Steam avatar)

Profile banners

Cosmetic image assets (frames, backgrounds, badges)

2.6 Hosting & Domain

Frontend / API hosting: Vercel (free tier)

Custom Domain: eclip.pro

Bound to Vercel project as production domain

DNS: managed via your registrar (one.com) pointing to Vercel

Email:

noreply@eclip.pro via one.com SMTP

Used for:

Email verification

Password reset

Admin notifications (optional)

2.7 CS2 Game Servers

Provider: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

You have ≈£200 credits to use for CS2 dedicated servers.

Pattern:

Create an instance template with CS2 server installed & configured.

The orchestrator backend:

On match creation → calls GCP API to spin up a VM based on that template.

Passes match ID/config via startup scripts/env.

Waits for server to become ready.

On match end → shuts down the VM to save credits.

2.8 Anti-Cheat

Client: Windows-only app (separate project, C++/C#/Rust).

Backend: Node.js service/API (can live inside main backend at first).

Integration:

Client sends telemetry to AC backend.

CS2 server sends match data / events to the same backend.

AC backend writes events into DB (ACEvents), attaches to User & Match.

email

password

username

Require email verification before:

queuing for ranked matches

Password reset via email token.

Steam Login

Steam OpenID flow:

Return with SteamID

Attach SteamID to the existing account or create new one.

4.2 Account linking rules

A Steam account can only be linked to one Eclip.pro account.

Playing matches requires:

Verified email

Linked Steam account

If user created email-only account first, later they can link Steam.

4.3 Roles & Permissions

Roles:

USER — default.

VIP (optional later).

MOD — moderation tools (mutes, bans, forum actions).

ADMIN — full access:

All admin panel features

Config management

Economy adjustment

AC actions

Access examples:

USER:

Refresh tokens optional; can start with:

short-lived access (JWT) + longer-lived cookie

CSRF protection for sensitive actions.

IP & user agent logging for security (optional, but recommended).

5. PROGRESSION: XP, LEVELS, RANKS, COINS
5.1 XP & Level System

Level is separate from competitive rank.

XP sources:

Completing a match (win or loss)

Daily login

Completing tutorial (one-time)

Missions / achievements

Example XP values (tunable):

Match loss: 50 XP

Match win: 100 XP

Daily login: 25 XP

Tutorial completion: 200 XP

Achievement unlock: variable

Level curve:

Level 1 → 2: 200 XP

Level 2 → 3: 300 XP

Level 3 → 4: 400 XP

… gradually increasing.

Level is used for:

Profile prestige

Unlocking additional mini profile info (e.g., stats visibility)

Cosmetic access (maybe some items require minimum level)

5.2 Ranks & MMR

Rank tiers (10 levels):

Bronze

Silver

Gold

Platinum

Diamond

Elite

Master

Grandmaster

Legend

Immortal

Each tier can optionally have divisions (I / II / III).

Internal logic:

Player has an MMR score (e.g., starting at 1000).

Each rank tier corresponds to an MMR range:

Bronze: 0–999

Silver: 1000–1199

Gold: 1200–1399

...

Immortal: 2600+

After each match:

MMR changes based on:

Win/loss

Opponent MMR

Personal performance (optional)

When MMR crosses threshold → rank up/down event

Create a rank-changed notification

Maybe show a rank-up animation on dashboard.

5.3 Coins (Soft Currency)

Earned purely by playing (no real money for now).

Base design:

Win: 0.10 coins

Loss: 0.02 coins

(Values can be scaled later; think of them as “virtual cents”.)

Other sources:

Achievements

Missions

Daily login streaks

One-time tutorial completion

Usage:

Buy cosmetics:

Avatar frames

Profile banners

Badges

Titles

Redeem for Steam gift cards:

Example: 5.00 coins → 5$ Steam gift card

Payouts are rare & slow to avoid abuse:

Minimum threshold: 5$ or higher

Cooldown between withdrawals

One per account per X days

Anti-abuse:

Monitor multi-accounting with same SteamID.

Flag suspicious rapid earning.

Manual admin review for frequent cashouts.

6. GAME MODES & MATCHMAKING DESIGN
6.1 Game Modes (Planned)

Primary for launch:

5v5 Competitive (standard CS2 comp style)

Later:

2v2 Wingman-like (future)

1v1 Aim maps (future)

The system should be flexible but initially focus on 5v5.

6.2 Queue System (Faceit-style)

You chose Faceit-style (Option A earlier):

Players queue solo or in party (start with:

Solo queue

Later: add 2-stack, 5-stack)

Matchmaker automatically forms:

10 players for 5v5

No custom lobby creation by users initially.

6.3 Regions

Regions to support (configurable):

EU

NA

(Later: SA, CIS, SEA, etc.)

Players choose preferred region in settings or Play screen.

6.4 Queue Flow

User clicks Play in dashboard / Play page.

Pre-checks:

Logged in

Email verified

Steam linked

Not banned / restricted

Client sends join queue request:

Mode: 5v5

Region

Party info (if implemented)

Server:

Stores QueueTicket in DB & Redis.

Adds player to rank-based bucket.

Matchmaker:

Runs periodically (e.g., every few seconds).

Picks compatible players (MMR range + region).

Forms two teams of 5.

Creates a Match record.

Marks queue tickets as matched.

6.5 Match Lifecycle

Step 1: Match Created

Match row created (status = PENDING).

10 MatchPlayer records linked to that match.

Step 2: Server Orchestration

Orchestrator service:

Receives match created event.

Calls GCP to create CS2 VM instance using template:

Region matches player region.

Startup script sets:

Map rotation

Tickrate

Match ID

Waits until server is reachable.

Updates Match with:

serverHost, serverPort

status = LIVE or READY.

Step 3: Notify Players

Backend sends:

Notification: “Match found”

Frontend shows:

Match found panel with connect info.

Or an auto-connect link string connect IP:PORT; password xyz.

Step 4: During Match

CS2 server:

Logs kills, deaths, rounds, etc.

Either:

Using plugin / extension

Or reading logs externally and posting to API

AC client:

Sends telemetry.

Step 5: Match End

Server (or plugin) calls backend:

POST /api/matches/:id/result

Includes:

Final score

Per-player stats:

Kills, deaths, assists, HS, MVPs, damage, etc.

Backend:

Sets match status = FINISHED.

Writes all stats to DB.

Updates user summary stats.

Calculates:

MMR change

Rank changes

XP & coin rewards

Enqueues notifications.

Orchestrator:

Shuts down VM so it stops burning credits.

6.6 Penalties

If a player quits / AFKs:

Mark as leaver in MatchPlayer.

Apply:

Reduced or zero rewards

Temporary queue cooldown (stacking if repeated)

Potential AC/ban review if extreme

10. ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM DESIGN (OVERVIEW)
10.1 AC Client (Windows)

Responsibilities:

Detect presence of known cheat processes (blacklist).

Monitor suspicious overlay windows.

Collect gameplay-related metrics:

Mouse movement patterns

Reaction times

Bhop/movement patterns

Communicate securely with AC backend (HTTPS or secure WebSocket).

Only runs while:

Eclip match is active.

Player is connected to Eclip’s CS2 servers.

Does NOT:

Spy on unrelated activity.

Log keystrokes.

Capture full-screen frames (unless explicitly accepted in future).

10.2 Server-side Telemetry

CS2 server plugin / log reader will send:

Per-kill data:

Killer & victim SteamIDs

Weapon

Headshot yes/no

Distance

Round events:

Round winner

Bomb plant/defuse (later)

Match summary stats:

K/D/A

MVPs

Score

10.3 AC Backend Logic

Data stored as ACEvent records:

userId

matchId

code (e.g., KNOWN_CHEAT_PROCESS, AIM_SNAP_PATTERN, etc.)

severity (1–10)

details string

createdAt

It maintains a suspicion score for each user:

Each ACEvent adds to the score (with severity).

Score decays over time without new events.

Thresholds:

Low: visible only in admin panel.

Medium: maybe trust factor adjustments.

High: automatic queue restrictions / temp bans.

Extreme: automatic permanent bans (for blatant cheat signatures).

Integration:

AC events shown in:

User detail view (admins).

Match detail (which players flagged).

AC bans integrated with normal ban system.

11. INFRA DETAILS & FREE USAGE STRATEGY
11.1 Vercel

Hosts frontend + API.

Uses project env vars for:

DATABASE_URL (Neon)

REDIS_URL

CLOUDINARY credentials

SMTP config

Steam API keys

API base URL, WS URL

11.2 Neon

Free tier Postgres.

All core data.

Use efficient indexes on:

Users (email, username, steamId)

Matches (createdAt, status)

Queue tickets (status, region, mmrAtJoin)

AC events (userId, createdAt)

11.3 Redis

Free-tier cloud instance.

Use simple structures:

Sorted sets for matchmaking buckets.

Simple keys for presence & rate limits.

11.4 Cloudinary

Use free plan initially.

Only store essential media:

Avatars, banners, cosmetics art.

11.5 Google Cloud

Use free credits for:

CS2 VM instances only.

Servers:

Only spun up when matches exist.

Stopped/terminated after match.

Rate-limit concurrent games to budget.

11.6 one.com Email

noreply@eclip.pro SMTP:

Send email verification links.

Send password reset links.
