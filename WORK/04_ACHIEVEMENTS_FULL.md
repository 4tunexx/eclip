# Achievements – Framework

We will have at least 50 achievements combining:

- Level milestones
- ESR milestones
- Match count
- Win count
- Kill / headshot / MVP / clutch milestones
- Forum / community milestones
- Daily mission completion milestones
- VIP / Insider / event related milestones

Each achievement should have:

- `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `rarity`
- `metricType`, `target`
- `rewardXp`, `rewardBadgeId` (optional)

Admin panel must allow full CRUD and manual grant to users.
