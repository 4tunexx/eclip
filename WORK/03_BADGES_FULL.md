# Badges – Framework

This file reserves the structure for 50 badges,
but the detailed list is already very long in this conversation.

For the coding agent:

- Store badges in a `Badge` (or generic `Cosmetic`) table.
- Fields per badge:
  - `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `rarity`, `imageUrl`, `unlockType`, `unlockRefId`

Admin panel must allow full CRUD + image URL editing for every badge.

(You can re-use or extend the example identifiers from `02_MISSIONS_FULL.md` and this conversation as needed.)
